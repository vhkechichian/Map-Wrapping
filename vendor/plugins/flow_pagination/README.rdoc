= FlowPagination

FlowPagination link renderer plugin for Mislav's
{WillPaginate}[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/master]
plugin (Twitter like pagination).

Instead of showing page links, this plugin/gem change the rendering of
WillPaginate to display, at the bottom of the page's records, the "More" button.
And when clicked it will add the next set of records (next page) right below
the previous ones.

== Requirements

* Mislav's {WillPaginate}[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/master]
  plugin/gem.

== Installation

I've created a category listing (index action) to give a basic example.

Configure +WillPaginate+ and +FlowPagination+ gems (config/environment.rb):

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    [...]
    config.gem 'mislav-will_paginate', :lib => 'will_paginate',
        :source => 'http://gems.github.com'

    config.gem 'mexpolk-flow_pagination', :lib => 'flow_pagination',
        :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
    [...]
  end

To install these gems type the following rake task:

  rake gems:install

=== Install It as a Plugin

  script/plugin install git://github.com/mislav/will_paginate.git
  script/plugin install git://github.com/mexpolk/flow_pagination.git

== Usage

There's flow_pagination_example[http://github.com/mexpolk/flow_pagination_example/tree/master]
application to see this gem in action.

Enjoy!
