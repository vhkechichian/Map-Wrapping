<h3>Help</h3>

<h4>Why doesn't it work?</h4>
<p>It's beta, so things may break, go missing or just plain not work.
But they should work, and I'd be very interested if they don't work, so please drop me a
line at tim@geothings.net and I'll take a look</p>

<h4>Why can't I use google maps?</h4>
<p>This application is designed for use with the openstreetmap project.
There are legal and ethical arguments not to use Google Maps when rectifiying
and processing out of copyright maps. However, in my opinion you can use Google Satellite,
so you may see a way to add this
later.</p>

<h4>WMS & JOSM</h4>

<p>Grab the wms link and paste that into the relevant place using the wmsplugin.
Have a look on the openstreetmap wiki for more info.</p>

<h4>Can I get the code and help?</h4>
<p>Yes. you can get the code here: http://svn2.geothings.net/mapwarper/ it's currently MIT licenced<br />
. You can contact me, Tim Waters, by mail at tim@geothings.net</p>

<p>By uploading images to the website you agree that you allow anyone to view and use them,
including changing control points etc. <br />
So we recommend that you have permission to upload them.

description if there
are any special condtions.<br />
Soon, users will be able to make maps private.<br />
