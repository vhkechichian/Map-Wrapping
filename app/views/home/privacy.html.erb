<h3>Mapwarper</h3>
<p>
Mapwarper is free to use, open source map warper / map georectifier, and image georeferencer tool for individuals and small groups.  Find maps and other imagery, upload, and rectify against a reference map. You can then download the results and use the warped map in your mapping applications.

<h3>Your Data and Contributions</h3>

<p>You contributions and maps are public and available for others to view and use.</p>

<h4> Maps</h4>

<p>
  When you upload maps to mapwarper.net you agree that you are lawfully entitled and have full authority to license mapwarper.net
  to use any maps uploaded. You can delete your own maps at any time. Deleting a map also deletes all its associated contributions, such as any control points added by other users.  If you believe someone has uploaded a map that is not theirs, or that you own the copyright to, you can contact me at <%= APP_CONFIG['reply_to'] %>.
</p>

<h4>Contributions</h4>

<p>
  You can contribute by adding/deleting/modifying control points of maps in the mapwarper. A control point associates a point on a map with its location on a contemporary map. A collection of control points are then used to warp or rectify a map.  Additionally, you can help others by cropping maps. Cropping maps is done by drawing a polygon or number of polygons around a map. All of these data points are considered your "Contributions" in mapwarper.

<h4 id="use-data">How goes Mapwarper use your data?</h4>

<p>
We do not  sell, rent or exchange your personal information with any third party. <br />

The maps and contributions that you make are stored on our servers and are open in that are publicly accessible. We may use this information to process other data (e.g. warping another map based on control points) or serve them directly. We may validate or process your contributions by automatic or manual processes (e.g. for analysing error rates of control points.) 
</p>
<p>Maps are able to be downloaded and viewed by third parties by e.g. WMS and Tile endpoints. Control points can also be downloaded by others. </p>


<h4 id="delete-data">How Can You Delete Your Data or Account?</h4>
<h5 id="delete-map">Delete my maps</h5>
<p>Go to the Edit tab of the map you want to delete and click on the "Delete this map" link. This will delete the map from our servers, however, note that maps are publicly available; deleting a map from our servers will not ensure that every copy of it is deleted, since others may have copied or reused the image prior to deletion. If you delete your account, all the maps that you have uploaded are also deleted. This is not reversible. </p>

<h5 id="delete-contributions">Delete my contributions</h5>
<p>Your contributions are open and public. You can manually delete your contributions, but they will still be recorded in the activity tab of the application. For example, if you put control points on a map and later delete them, the activity tab of the map will show the creation and deletion of the control points and may let other users revert your changes. You cannot wipe out your contributions on others maps, however deleting one of your own maps will delete the contributions associated with it.   Itâ€™s important to understand that mapwarper is not able to find, delete, or de-identify any copies of your contributions that other users may have created. </p>


<h5 id="delete account">Delete Account</h5>
<p>
  Users can delete their account at any time, by clicking on the <%= link_to 'settings link', edit_user_registration_path %> to open your user settings, and clicking the "cancel my account" button. <br />   
  Deleting your account will also delete your uploaded maps, and any contributions made associated with each map. 
</p>
